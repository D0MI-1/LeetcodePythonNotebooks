The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.\n",

When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem.
